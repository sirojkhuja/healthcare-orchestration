# Healthcare Orchestration & Integration Platform (Laravel)
**Single Source of Truth (SSoT) — Build Spec + Standards + Runbooks + API Catalog**

**Project codename:** MedFlow

**Last updated:** 2026-02-28 (Asia/Tashkent)

---

## 0. Purpose
Build an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant, event-driven **Healthcare Workflow & Integration Platform**:
- Manage patients, providers, clinics, appointments, treatment plans, lab orders, prescriptions, billing, insurance claims.
- Orchestrate workflows with **state machines**.
- Integrate with Uzbekistan services: **Payme, Click, Uzum**, SMS providers (**Eskiz, Play Mobile, TextUp**), **Telegram Bot**, **Email**, **Google Auth**, plus optional **MyID** and **E-IMZO**.
- Provide **tons of endpoints**, complete **API documentation**, and complete **developer documentation**.
- Built to be **AI-agent friendly** (Codex-ready): small files, strict patterns, explicit rules, checklists, and a single reference.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules (AI-Agent Friendly)
These rules are enforced by CI and must be followed by humans and AI agents.

### 2.1 Small Files & Single Responsibility
- **Max file length:** 250 lines (soft), 400 lines (hard). Exceeding hard limit fails CI.
- **Max method length:** 40 lines.
- **Max class public methods:** 12.
- **Cyclomatic complexity:** keep ≤ 10 per method.

### 2.2 Layering & Dependency Rules (Clean Architecture)
Allowed dependencies:
- `Presentation` → may depend on `Application` interfaces/DTOs.
- `Application` → may depend on `Domain` (entities, value objects, domain services, events).
- `Domain` → depends on nothing else (no Laravel, no Eloquent, no HTTP).
- `Infrastructure` → implements interfaces defined in `Application`/`Domain`.

Forbidden:
- Domain importing Laravel classes.
- Controllers using Eloquent models directly for business logic.
- Controllers making external HTTP calls directly.
- Cross-module imports without public contracts.

### 2.3 Dependency Injection Everywhere
- No `new` in business code except factories.
- All external services accessed through interfaces and injected.
- All integrations behind adapters.

### 2.4 Patterns Required
This project intentionally uses many patterns; use them consistently:
- Repository, Unit of Work (transaction boundary), Factory, Builder
- Strategy, Adapter, Facade (internal), Decorator
- Observer (events), Mediator (event bus), Command
- Chain of Responsibility (pipelines), Specification
- State pattern (state machine)
- CQRS (Commands/Queries) at application layer
- Outbox pattern for Kafka publishing

### 2.5 "No Magic" Rule
- No hidden global helpers for business logic.
- Each use-case must be implemented as an **Application Command/Query handler**.

### 2.6 Security-by-Default
- **Database ports MUST NOT be exposed** in docker-compose.
- All secrets via env / secret manager, never committed.
- TLS for Redis and external integrations.
- OAuth tokens encrypted at rest.

### 2.7 Documentation Required for Every Change
Every PR must include:
- Updated OpenAPI (or explicitly "no API change")
- Updated ADR if architecture decision
- Updated tests
- Updated module docs if behavior changed

---

## 3. Product Requirements
### 3.1 Tenancy
- Multi-tenant by `tenant_id` (clinic network / enterprise group).
- Tenant isolation at DB row-level via:
  - mandatory `tenant_id` column,
  - global query scope in infrastructure only,
  - request context sets tenant.

### 3.2 Roles & Permissions
Roles (baseline):
- SuperAdmin, TenantAdmin, ClinicAdmin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, LabTech, BillingAgent, Patient.

Permissions:
- Fine-grained action permissions, policy-driven.
- Permission caching per user with event-based invalidation.
- Custom roles are tenant-scoped and user-role assignments are tenant-scoped.
- Users are shared identity accounts attached to tenants through tenant-scoped memberships.
- Tenant user lifecycle status is membership-scoped with `active`, `inactive`, and `locked` states.
- Attaching an existing global user account to a tenant must not silently overwrite shared identity fields; shared identity changes go through explicit user update endpoints.
- Shared profile data and avatar metadata live with the global identity account, while tenant-admin profile access remains constrained by tenant membership and `profiles.*` permissions.
- Permission definitions and permission groups are fixed catalog data, not tenant-editable records.

### 3.3 Audit
- Full audit trail for regulated objects:
  - who, what, when, before/after, request-id/correlation-id.
- Write-once storage semantics for audit events.

---

## 4. Architecture
### 4.1 High-Level
- HTTP API (Laravel) is the edge.
- Domain is pure.
- Application orchestrates use-cases.
- Infrastructure provides adapters:
  - DB repositories
  - Kafka producer/consumer
  - Redis caches
  - External integrations

### 4.2 Module Boundaries
Each module has its own domain, application handlers, contracts, and infrastructure.
Modules:
1. Identity & Access (IAM)
2. Tenant & Clinic Management
3. Patient
4. Provider (Doctor/Nurse)
5. Scheduling (Appointment)
6. Treatment Plans
7. Lab Orders & Results
8. Prescriptions
9. Billing & Payments
10. Insurance Claims
11. Notifications
12. Integrations Hub
13. Audit & Compliance
14. Observability

---

## 6. State Machines
### 6.1 Appointment State Machine
States:
- `draft` → `scheduled` → `confirmed` → `checked_in` → `in_progress` → `completed`
- side branches: `canceled`, `no_show`, `rescheduled`

Guards:
- cannot confirm past appointment
- cannot check-in without confirmation (unless admin override)
- cannot complete unless in_progress
- terminal states may only recover through explicit `restore`

Transition rules:
- `schedule`: `draft -> scheduled`
- `confirm`: `scheduled -> confirmed`
- `check-in`: `confirmed -> checked_in`, or `scheduled -> checked_in` only with recorded admin override
- `start`: `checked_in -> in_progress`
- `complete`: `in_progress -> completed`
- `cancel`: `scheduled|confirmed -> canceled`, reason required
- `no-show`: `scheduled|confirmed -> no_show`, reason required, only after scheduled start
- `reschedule`: `scheduled|confirmed -> rescheduled`, reason required, replacement slot reference required
- `restore`: `canceled|no_show|rescheduled -> scheduled`, only while the original slot has not fully elapsed

Aggregate minimum fields:
- `appointment_id`
- `tenant_id`
- `patient_id`
- `provider_id`
- optional `clinic_id`
- optional `room_id`
- `scheduled_start_at`
- `scheduled_end_at`
- `timezone`
- `status`
- latest transition metadata including actor, timestamp, reason, admin override, restored-from status, and replacement-slot reference where applicable

Transitions produce events for Kafka + audit.

### 6.2 Insurance Claim State Machine
- `draft` → `submitted` → `under_review` → `approved|denied` → `paid` (if approved)

### 6.3 Payment State Machine
- `initiated` → `pending` → `captured|failed|canceled` → `refunded` (optional)

### 6.4 Implementation Contract
- All state transitions go through **Application handlers**.
- State machine logic lives in Domain (pure), invoked via Application.

## 7. Messaging (Kafka)
### 7.1 Topics
- `medflow.appointments.v1`
- `medflow.treatments.v1`
- `medflow.billing.v1`
- `medflow.claims.v1`
- `medflow.notifications.v1`
- `medflow.audit.v1`
- `medflow.integrations.v1`

### 7.2 Event Envelope (Standard)
Fields:
- `event_id` (UUID)
- `event_type`
- `occurred_at`
- `tenant_id`
- `correlation_id`
- `causation_id`
- `actor` (user_id/service)
- `payload` (schema per event)
- `version`

### 7.3 Delivery Guarantees
- At-least-once processing.
- Idempotency required for consumers.

### 7.4 Outbox Pattern (Required)
- Business transaction writes domain changes + outbox record in same DB transaction.
- Outbox relay publishes to Kafka.
- Relay retries with backoff.

---

## 8. Caching (Redis)
### 8.1 What to Cache
- permission sets
- provider availability
- clinic settings
- integration token metadata
- rate limit buckets
- frequently queried reference data

### 8.2 Patterns
- Cache-aside with explicit invalidation on domain events.
- Tagged caching by tenant.

### 8.3 Security
- Redis TLS + auth
- keys include tenant prefix

---

## 9. Database (PostgreSQL)
### 9.1 Principles
- DB schema is authoritative and versioned by migrations.
- Use UUIDs for public identifiers.
- Separate internal numeric ids allowed but not exposed.

### 9.2 Constraints & Indexing
- Foreign keys enforced.
- Partial indexes for common filters (tenant_id + status + dates).
- Full-text search for patient/provider directories.

---

## 10. Integrations Hub (Uzbekistan + General)
### 10.1 Integration Framework
All integrations follow the same pattern:
- `Contract` (interface) in Application
- `Adapter` in Infrastructure
- `Client` wraps HTTP
- `Authenticator` handles auth
- `RetryPolicy` + `CircuitBreaker`
- `WebhookVerifier` for inbound
- `Mapper` converts external payloads → internal DTOs

### 10.2 Payment Integrations
- Payme
- Click
- Uzum

Common features:
- create payment
- query status
- handle callbacks/webhooks
- reconcile
- refunds (if supported)

### 10.3 Identity
- Google OAuth (login)
- Optional: MyID (KYC / identity verification)

### 10.4 SMS Providers
- Eskiz
- Play Mobile
- TextUp

Strategy pattern:
- `SmsProvider` interface
- dynamic routing rules:
  - failover provider order
  - per-tenant provider
  - per-message type (OTP vs marketing)

### 10.5 Telegram Bot
- patient reminders
- clinic broadcast
- support channel

### 10.6 Email
- transactional email service (SMTP or provider)
- templates versioned

### 10.7 Additional Uzbekistan Integrations (Optional)
These are designed as plug-ins; implement when you have credentials:
- E-IMZO e-signature workflows
- Global ID Gate / other local identity aggregators
- Tax/receipt systems (if applicable)
- Local maps/geocoding providers (if needed)

---

## 11. API Design Standards
### 11.1 REST + Action Endpoints
- Resource-first routes.
- Action routes for transitions (confirm, cancel, approve).

### 11.2 Versioning
- URL: `/api/v1/...`
- Event versioning separate from API version.

### 11.3 Error Model
Standard error:
- `code`, `message`, `details`, `trace_id`, `correlation_id`

### 11.4 Pagination
- cursor pagination preferred.

### 11.5 Idempotency
- Idempotency keys for:
  - payment creation
  - appointment scheduling
  - client-initiated webhook processing
- provider-initiated webhooks that cannot send `Idempotency-Key` must use provider-native replay identifiers plus persisted delivery records

---

## 12. Endpoint Catalog (High-Level)
> This is the initial catalog. Each endpoint is documented in OpenAPI with full schemas and examples.

### 12.1 Auth & Identity
- POST `/api/v1/auth/login`
- POST `/api/v1/auth/logout`
- POST `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
- GET  `/api/v1/auth/me`
- GET  `/api/v1/auth/google/redirect`
- GET  `/api/v1/auth/google/callback`

### 12.2 Tenants & Clinics
- CRUD tenants
- CRUD clinics
- clinic settings
- tenant bootstrap attaches the creator as an active member of the new tenant and assigns a bootstrap administrator role
- tenant settings: locale, timezone, currency
- tenant limits: users, clinics, providers, patients, storage_gb, monthly_notifications
- tenant usage reports used, limit, and remaining values for each documented limit key
- clinic records: code, name, status, contact details, location codes, address fields, notes
- clinic lifecycle states: active, inactive; delete only while inactive
- clinic settings: timezone override, default appointment duration, slot interval, walk-in flag, confirmation flag, telemedicine flag
- departments and rooms are clinic-owned nested resources with unique per-clinic codes
- clinic work hours are weekly schedules with non-overlapping daily time intervals
- clinic holidays are inclusive non-overlapping date ranges
- location endpoints expose approved global reference data and are not tenant-owned

### 12.3 Users & RBAC
- CRUD users
- roles
- permissions

### 12.4 Patients
- CRUD patients
- search
- attach documents
- patient master records: first name, last name, middle name, preferred name, sex, birth date, national ID, contact details, approved location codes, address fields, notes
- patient deletion is a soft delete; deleted patients are excluded from active directory reads but retained for auditability

### 12.5 Providers
- CRUD providers
- availability
- calendars

### 12.6 Scheduling (Appointments)
- CRUD appointments
- actions: schedule, confirm, check-in, start, complete, cancel, no-show, reschedule
- appointment booking owns patient, provider, optional clinic and room assignment, scheduled slot, status, and transition metadata
- `POST /appointments` creates draft appointments; `PATCH /appointments/{appointmentId}` and `DELETE /appointments/{appointmentId}` apply only to draft appointments so workflow transitions remain action-based
- appointment deletion is a soft delete; deleted draft appointments leave active directory reads but remain auditable
- appointment search supports `q`, `status`, `patient_id`, `provider_id`, `clinic_id`, `room_id`, `scheduled_from`, `scheduled_to`, `created_from`, `created_to`, and `limit`
- appointment export uses the active search result set, supports `format=csv`, stores a private export artifact, and returns export metadata with `filters` and `storage`
- appointment audit views use immutable audit events with object type `appointment` and remain accessible for soft-deleted appointments inside tenant scope
- draft appointments do not consume slot capacity yet; availability and provider-calendar reads continue to ignore draft appointments until later scheduling workflow tasks
- reschedule closes the current appointment as `rescheduled` and preserves the original slot history for the replacement booking

### 12.7 Treatments
- CRUD treatment plans
- search treatment plans
- manage ordered treatment-plan items
- actions: approve, start, pause, resume, finish, reject
- treatment plans own patient linkage, provider linkage, title, optional summary and goals, optional planned start and end dates, status, transition metadata, and lifecycle timestamps
- `POST /treatment-plans` creates `draft` plans; generic `PATCH` is limited to `draft|approved`
- treatment-plan delete is a soft delete limited to `draft|rejected`
- treatment plan lifecycle is `draft -> approved -> active -> paused -> active -> finished`, with `draft|approved -> rejected`
- treatment plans expose `item_count` in read models once treatment items are enabled
- treatment items are ordered plan subresources with `item_type`, title, optional description, optional instructions, and one-based `sort_order`
- treatment item writes are limited to parent plans in `draft|approved`; started or terminal plans are read-only for item changes
- treatment-item insert, move, and delete operations reindex sibling order transactionally to keep a contiguous ordered list

### 12.8 Labs
- CRUD lab orders
- receive results (webhook)

### 12.9 Prescriptions
- CRUD prescriptions
- actions: issue, cancel, dispense
- prescriptions are tenant-scoped records with patient and provider linkage, optional encounter and treatment-item linkage, medication snapshot fields, explicit issue/cancel/dispense actions, and soft-delete retention
- prescription status values are `draft`, `issued`, `dispensed`, and `canceled`
- generic `PATCH /prescriptions/{prescriptionId}` is draft-only and workflow changes happen only through `:issue`, `:cancel`, and `:dispense`

### 12.10 Billing & Payments
- invoices
- payments: initiate, status, refund
- reconcile

### 12.11 Insurance
- claims
- actions: submit, review, approve/deny, mark-paid

### 12.12 Notifications
- email/sms/telegram templates
- send test
- templates are tenant-scoped, versioned, and soft-deletable
- email templates require subject + body; sms and telegram use body only
- test-render uses strict `{{path.to.value}}` placeholders and rejects missing or non-scalar final values

### 12.13 Integrations
- manage credentials per tenant
- webhook endpoints
- health checks

### 12.14 Audit
- query audit events

### 12.15 Observability
- health, readiness, liveness
- metrics endpoint

**Note:** The full endpoint matrix (200+ routes) is produced in `/docs/api/endpoint-matrix.md` section below with route naming conventions, request/response schemas, and state transitions.

### 13.1 Test Types
- Unit tests (Domain + pure Application logic)
- Feature tests (HTTP API)
- Integration tests (DB, Redis, Kafka test containers)
- Contract tests (OpenAPI schema validation)
- Consumer-driven contract tests for integrations (where possible)

  - Application
  - Infrastructure critical paths
- 100% for Domain + Application required.

### 13.3 Test Data
- Builders + Mother objects.
- Deterministic time.

---

## 14. Observability & Logging (Best Practices)
### 14.1 Logging
- Structured JSON logs.
- Correlation IDs:
  - `X-Request-Id`
  - `X-Correlation-Id`
- Log levels standardized.

### 14.2 Tracing
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for:
  - inbound HTTP
  - outbound HTTP integrations
  - DB queries (sampled)
  - Kafka produce/consume

### 14.3 Errors
- Sentry for exception aggregation.

### 14.4 Metrics
- Prometheus metrics for:
  - request latency
  - queue lag
  - kafka consumer lag
  - integration error rates
  - cache hit ratio

### 14.5 Central Logs
- Elastic for log indexing and dashboards.

---

## 15. Security
- OAuth2 / JWT
- TOTP-based MFA with recovery codes for accounts that enable MFA
- MFA-enabled logins must return `MFA_REQUIRED` with a short-lived challenge until second-factor verification succeeds
- MFA secrets encrypted at rest; recovery codes stored only as hashes
- managed API keys may be issued for machine-to-machine access, must be stored only as hashes, and are returned only once at creation
- tenant IP allowlists use CIDR entries and must be enforced for API-key-authenticated traffic whenever a tenant scope has active entries
- device registration is user-owned and must support metadata refresh for an existing installation without duplicate device rows
- Rate limiting per tenant and per IP
- Webhook signature verification for all inbound callbacks
- Encrypt integration secrets at rest
- PII handling: field-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Audit logging mandatory
- Security event tracking mandatory for authentication, MFA, and other sensitive IAM actions

---

## 16. CI/CD
### 16.1 Pipeline Gates
- lint (Pint)
- static analysis (PHPStan + Psalm)
- unit tests
- feature tests
- integration tests (optional on main)

# Appendix A — Endpoint Matrix (Full Inventory v1)
> Target inventory: **~280 endpoints** (within requested 200–400). This matrix is the authoritative route catalog. Each endpoint maps to exactly one Application handler (Command/Query). Each route must be documented in OpenAPI with schemas and examples.

## A.0 Conventions
- Base prefix: `/api/v1`
- Route format: `METHOD /path` → `UseCase` → `Module`
- `:action` routes are explicit workflow/state transitions.
- Bulk actions use `/bulk`.
- Exports use `/export`.
- Search endpoints use `/search` or `?q=`.
- Webhooks live under `/webhooks/{provider}`.
- Admin-only endpoints live under `/admin/*`.

---

## A.1 Auth & Identity (16)
- POST `/auth/login` → `LoginCommand` → IAM
- POST `/auth/logout` → `LogoutCommand` → IAM
- POST `/auth/refresh` → `RefreshTokenCommand` → IAM
- GET `/auth/me` → `GetMeQuery` → IAM
- POST `/auth/password/forgot` → `RequestPasswordResetCommand` → IAM

---

## A.2 Tenants (12)
- GET `/tenants` → `ListTenantsQuery` → Tenancy
- POST `/tenants` → `CreateTenantCommand` → Tenancy
- GET `/tenants/{tenantId}` → `GetTenantQuery` → Tenancy
- PATCH `/tenants/{tenantId}` → `UpdateTenantCommand` → Tenancy
- DELETE `/tenants/{tenantId}` → `DeleteTenantCommand` → Tenancy
- POST `/tenants/{tenantId}:activate` → `ActivateTenantCommand` → Tenancy
- POST `/tenants/{tenantId}:suspend` → `SuspendTenantCommand` → Tenancy
- GET `/tenants/{tenantId}/usage` → `GetTenantUsageQuery` → Tenancy
- GET `/tenants/{tenantId}/limits` → `GetTenantLimitsQuery` → Tenancy
- PUT `/tenants/{tenantId}/limits` → `UpdateTenantLimitsCommand` → Tenancy
- GET `/tenants/{tenantId}/settings` → `GetTenantSettingsQuery` → Tenancy
- PUT `/tenants/{tenantId}/settings` → `UpdateTenantSettingsCommand` → Tenancy

Tenant route notes:
- `GET /tenants` returns only tenants where the authenticated actor has a membership.
- `POST /tenants` is an authenticated bootstrap route and does not require an active tenant context.
- Tenant-specific routes accept `{tenantId}` as the documented tenant context source and may also accept `X-Tenant-Id`; mismatches fail closed.
- Tenant lifecycle states are `active` and `suspended`.
- Suspended tenants remain administratively accessible for authorized tenant actors so recovery and reactivation remain possible.

- Clinic settings currently contain `timezone`, `default_appointment_duration_minutes`, `slot_interval_minutes`, `allow_walk_ins`, `require_appointment_confirmation`, and `telemedicine_enabled`.
- Clinic work hours are a weekly schedule keyed by `monday` through `sunday`, with zero or more non-overlapping `HH:MM` intervals per day.
- Clinic holidays are inclusive date ranges with `name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `is_closed`, and `notes`.
- Location endpoints return approved read-only global reference data.

Patient search, summary, timeline, and export operate on the active tenant-owned patient directory:

- patient search supports `q`, `sex`, `city_code`, `district_code`, `birth_date_from`, `birth_date_to`, `created_from`, `created_to`, `has_email`, `has_phone`, and `limit`
- search token matching uses AND semantics across patient names, `national_id`, `email`, and `phone`
- patient summary is derived from the active patient master record plus immutable patient audit events
- patient timeline returns patient audit events newest first
- patient export writes CSV only through the private shared exports storage and returns an export reference rather than a public file URL
- export creation writes audit action `patients.exported` with object type `patient_export`
- patient contacts require `name` plus at least one of `phone` or `email`; only one active primary contact may exist per patient
- patient contacts list ordered by `is_primary desc`, `is_emergency desc`, `name asc`, and `created_at asc`
- patient tags are replaced as a full normalized set; normalization trims, collapses repeated internal whitespace, lowercases, discards empty values, and sorts alphabetically
- patient document routes expose metadata only, store files on the private shared attachments disk, and accept only `pdf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, and `webp` uploads up to `10 MiB`
- patient consents accept `consent_type`, `granted_by_name`, optional `granted_by_relationship`, optional `granted_at`, optional `expires_at`, and optional `notes`
- patient consent type is normalized to lowercase snake case; `granted_by_name` is required and `granted_at` defaults to the current timestamp
- patient consent status is derived as `active`, `expired`, or `revoked`; at most one active consent of the same type may exist for a patient at a time
- patient consent list ordered by active consents first, then `granted_at desc`, then `created_at desc`
- `POST /patients/{patientId}/consents/{consentId}:revoke` records `revoked_at` and optional `reason`; revoked consent history is retained and not hard-deleted in normal flows
- patient insurance links accept `insurance_code`, `policy_number`, optional `member_number`, optional `group_number`, optional `plan_name`, optional `effective_from`, optional `effective_to`, optional `is_primary`, and optional `notes`
- patient insurance links ordered by `is_primary desc`, `effective_from desc nulls last`, and `created_at desc`
- only one patient insurance link may be primary at a time; attaching a new primary policy clears the previous primary flag
- duplicate patient insurance links for `{patient_id, insurance_code, policy_number}` are conflicts
- patient external references accept `integration_key`, `external_id`, optional `external_type`, optional `display_name`, and optional JSON `metadata`
- patient external reference `external_type` defaults to `patient` and the tuple `{patient_id, integration_key, external_type, external_id}` must be unique
- patient contact, tag, document, consent, insurance-link, and external-reference mutations emit patient audit actions so they can appear in patient timelines

- GET `/providers/{providerId}/time-off` → `ListTimeOffQuery` → Provider
- POST `/providers/{providerId}/time-off` → `CreateTimeOffCommand` → Provider
- PATCH `/providers/{providerId}/time-off/{timeOffId}` → `UpdateTimeOffCommand` → Provider
- DELETE `/providers/{providerId}/time-off/{timeOffId}` → `DeleteTimeOffCommand` → Provider
- GET `/specialties` → `ListSpecialtiesQuery` → Provider
- POST `/specialties` → `CreateSpecialtyCommand` → Provider
- PATCH `/specialties/{specialtyId}` → `UpdateSpecialtyCommand` → Provider
- DELETE `/specialties/{specialtyId}` → `DeleteSpecialtyCommand` → Provider
- GET `/provider-groups` → `ListProviderGroupsQuery` → Provider
- POST `/provider-groups` → `CreateProviderGroupCommand` → Provider
- PUT `/provider-groups/{groupId}/members` → `SetProviderGroupMembersCommand` → Provider

Provider master records use the base fields `first_name`, `last_name`, `middle_name`, `preferred_name`, `provider_type`, `email`, `phone`, `clinic_id`, and `notes`:

- `first_name`, `last_name`, and `provider_type` are required on create
- `provider_type` enum values are `doctor`, `nurse`, and `other`
- `provider_type` is normalized to lowercase; `email` is lowercased when present and `phone` is trimmed
- `clinic_id` is optional, but when present it must reference an existing clinic in the same tenant scope
- provider list ordered by `last_name asc`, `first_name asc`, and `created_at asc`
- `DELETE /providers/{providerId}` is a soft delete; deleted providers are excluded from active directory reads but retained for auditability and future scheduling references
- provider CRUD mutations emit `providers.created`, `providers.updated`, and `providers.deleted` audit actions
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/profile` returns the base provider record plus provider-profile fields `professional_title`, `bio`, `years_of_experience`, `department_id`, `room_id`, `is_accepting_new_patients`, `languages`, and nested `department` and `room` summaries when available
- provider profile data is a one-to-one extension; `is_accepting_new_patients` defaults to `true` and `languages` are normalized by trimming, collapsing repeated internal whitespace, removing empties, deduplicating case-insensitively, and sorting alphabetically
- `department_id` and `room_id` are optional, but if either is present the provider must belong to a clinic and the selected department or room must belong to that clinic; if both are present and the room has a department assignment, it must match `department_id`
- if provider `clinic_id` changes through base CRUD, provider-profile `department_id` and `room_id` are cleared automatically to prevent stale clinic-location links
- specialties are tenant-owned catalog records with required `name`, optional `description`, case-insensitive unique names per tenant, and list ordering `name asc`, `created_at asc`
- `PUT /providers/{providerId}/specialties` replaces the full specialty set using `specialties[] = {specialty_id, is_primary?}`; each specialty may appear only once and at most one specialty may be primary
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/specialties` returns assigned specialties ordered by `is_primary desc`, `name asc`, `assigned_at asc`
- `DELETE /specialties/{specialtyId}` fails with `409 Conflict` while the specialty is still assigned to any provider
- provider licenses use `license_type`, `license_number`, `issuing_authority`, optional `jurisdiction`, optional `issued_on`, optional `expires_on`, and optional `notes`
- `license_type` is normalized to lowercase snake case; `{provider_id, license_type, license_number}` must be unique; license status is derived as `active` or `expired`
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/licenses` returns licenses with active licenses first, then `expires_on asc nulls last`, then `created_at asc`
- availability rules are scheduling-owned provider records with `scope_type`, `availability_type`, optional `weekday`, optional `specific_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and optional `notes`
- `scope_type` values are `weekly` and `date`; `availability_type` values are `available` and `unavailable`; weekly rules require `weekday` and forbid `specific_date`, while date rules require `specific_date` and forbid `weekday`
- availability rules conflict only when the same provider and tenant have the same `scope_type`, the same `availability_type`, the same weekday or specific date, and overlapping time ranges; cross-scope overlaps like `weekly available` plus `date unavailable` are allowed
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/availability/rules` returns rules ordered by `scope_type asc`, `weekday asc nulls last`, `specific_date asc nulls last`, `start_time asc`, and `created_at asc`
- availability mutation routes and `POST /providers/{providerId}/availability:rebuild-cache` require `Idempotency-Key`
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/availability/slots` accepts `date_from`, `date_to`, and optional `limit`; the slot window may span at most `31` calendar days, `limit` defaults to `200`, and `limit` may not exceed `1000`
- slot generation is a scheduling availability view only; it unions matching available rules, subtracts matching unavailable rules, intersects clinic work hours when the provider is assigned to a clinic, returns no slots on closed clinic holidays, and does not subtract booked appointments before appointment scheduling work lands later
- slot timezone resolves by clinic settings timezone override, then tenant settings timezone, then app timezone; slot duration resolves by clinic settings `default_appointment_duration_minutes` or `30`; slot interval resolves by clinic settings `slot_interval_minutes` or `15`
- availability slot views use tenant-scoped cache domain `availability` keyed by provider plus date window and limit; rule mutations, cache rebuild, clinic settings/work-hours/holiday/lifecycle changes, provider clinic assignment changes, provider soft delete, and tenant timezone changes invalidate that namespace
- availability audit actions are `availability.rules.created`, `availability.rules.updated`, `availability.rules.deleted`, and `availability.cache_rebuilt`
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/work-hours` returns the provider-owned weekly template projected from weekly availability rules; the response always contains all seven weekdays plus `provider_id`, `timezone`, and `updated_at`
- work-hours projection unions weekly available rules and subtracts weekly unavailable rules for the same weekday; clinic work hours and clinic holidays do not rewrite the provider-owned template and only affect effective calendar slots
- `PUT /providers/{providerId}/work-hours` is replacement-based using `days`; unknown weekday keys are rejected, intervals must use `HH:MM`, intervals must not overlap within a day, omitted weekdays become empty lists, and adjacent intervals are collapsed into a canonical interval set
- work-hours replacement rewrites the weekly schedule into canonical `weekly available` rules only and replaces the provider weekly rule set atomically
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/time-off` returns date-scoped unavailable intervals ordered by `specific_date asc`, `start_time asc`, and `created_at asc`
- provider time-off records use `id`, `provider_id`, `specific_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, optional `notes`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`; multi-day leave is represented as multiple records
- `POST /providers/{providerId}/time-off` requires `specific_date`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and optional `notes`; `PATCH /providers/{providerId}/time-off/{timeOffId}` supports partial updates of the same fields
- time-off mutations use the same date-unavailable conflict rules as low-level availability rules and require `Idempotency-Key`
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/calendar` accepts `date_from`, `date_to`, and optional `limit` using the same window rules as availability slots and returns `work_hours`, `time_off`, `slot_count`, `slots`, and `is_clinic_closed` for each day
- provider calendar combines the provider weekly template, date-specific time-off, clinic closures, and effective slots; booked appointment subtraction remains out of scope until later scheduling tasks
- `GET /providers/{providerId}/calendar/export` accepts the same window query plus optional `format=csv`, stores a private export artifact, and returns export metadata with `filters` and `storage`
- provider schedule audit actions additionally include `providers.work_hours_updated`, `providers.time_off_created`, `providers.time_off_updated`, `providers.time_off_deleted`, and `providers.calendar_exported`
- appointments persist `patient_id`, `provider_id`, optional `clinic_id`, optional `room_id`, `status`, `scheduled_start_at`, `scheduled_end_at`, `timezone`, optional `last_transition`, soft-delete timestamp, and audit timestamps
- appointment create and update validate tenant-scoped patient, provider, clinic, and room references; `room_id` requires `clinic_id`, and an explicit appointment clinic must match the provider clinic assignment when the provider is already clinic-bound
- `GET /appointments` returns active tenant-scoped appointments ordered by `scheduled_start_at asc`, `created_at asc`, and `id asc`
- appointment search matches appointment IDs plus patient and provider display names using AND semantics across query tokens and deterministic relevance ordering
- appointment export writes audit action `appointments.exported` with object type `appointment_export`
- appointment CRUD audit actions are `appointments.created`, `appointments.updated`, and `appointments.deleted`
- appointment mutation routes `POST /appointments`, `PATCH /appointments/{appointmentId}`, and `DELETE /appointments/{appointmentId}` require `Idempotency-Key`
- provider groups are tenant-owned records with required `name`, optional `description`, optional `clinic_id`, and replacement-based member management through `provider_ids`
- `GET /provider-groups` returns `member_count`, `member_ids`, and ordered `members` summaries for each group
- provider extension audit actions include `providers.profile_updated`, `providers.specialties_set`, `providers.license_added`, `providers.license_removed`, `provider_specialties.created`, `provider_specialties.updated`, `provider_specialties.deleted`, `provider_groups.created`, and `provider_groups.members_updated`

- POST `/appointments:rebuild-cache` → `RebuildSchedulingCacheCommand` → Scheduling
- `POST /appointments/bulk` applies one shared change set across `1..100` distinct appointment ids, requires `Idempotency-Key`, and is all-or-nothing
- bulk draft updates support the same mutable fields as the single generic draft `PATCH /appointments/{appointmentId}` route
- bulk draft updates are limited to active `draft` appointments so explicit state-transition routes remain authoritative for scheduled workflows
- bulk draft updates return `operation_id`, `affected_count`, `updated_fields`, and the updated appointment payloads in input order
- bulk draft updates write one summary `appointments.bulk_updated` audit event plus per-appointment `appointments.updated` events linked to the bulk operation

- POST `/treatment-plans/{planId}:finish` → `FinishTreatmentPlanCommand` → Treatment
- POST `/treatment-plans/{planId}:reject` → `RejectTreatmentPlanCommand` → Treatment
- `T043` implements treatment-plan search plus ordered treatment-item routes defined in ADR `030`; no separate bulk treatment route is introduced because the canonical route inventory does not define one in this phase

### Encounters / visits
- GET `/encounters` → `ListEncountersQuery` → Treatment
- POST `/encounters` → `CreateEncounterCommand` → Treatment
- GET `/encounters/{encounterId}` → `GetEncounterQuery` → Treatment
- PATCH `/encounters/{encounterId}` → `UpdateEncounterCommand` → Treatment

- DELETE `/encounters/{encounterId}/procedures/{procId}` → `RemoveProcedureCommand` → Treatment
- GET `/encounters/export` → `ExportEncountersQuery` → Treatment
- POST `/encounters/bulk` → `BulkUpdateEncountersCommand` → Treatment
- `T044` implements encounters through ADR `031`.
- Encounters are tenant-scoped visit records with patient and provider linkage, optional treatment-plan and appointment linkage, optional clinic and room linkage, `open|completed|entered_in_error` status, `encountered_at`, `timezone`, optional `chief_complaint`, optional `summary`, optional `notes`, optional `follow_up_instructions`, and soft-delete retention.
- `GET /encounters` is the filterable directory route. It supports `q`, `status`, `patient_id`, `provider_id`, `treatment_plan_id`, `appointment_id`, `clinic_id`, `encounter_from`, `encounter_to`, `created_from`, `created_to`, and `limit`, and it returns `meta.filters`.
- Encounter exports reuse the active encounter list filter set, support `format=csv`, store a private export artifact, and write `encounters.exported`.
- Diagnoses are encounter-owned subresources with `code`, `display_name`, `diagnosis_type = primary|secondary`, and optional `notes`. Each encounter may have at most one primary diagnosis.
- Procedures are encounter-owned subresources with optional `treatment_item_id`, optional `code`, `display_name`, optional `performed_at`, and optional `notes`.
- Procedure linkage to treatment-plan items is allowed only when the encounter already links to a treatment plan and the referenced treatment item belongs to that plan with `item_type = procedure`.
- `POST /encounters/bulk` is the generic shared-change bulk route for active encounters. It requires `Idempotency-Key`, accepts `encounter_ids` plus a shared `changes` object, supports `1..100` distinct ids, is all-or-nothing, and may update only `status`, `provider_id`, `clinic_id`, `room_id`, `encountered_at`, and `timezone`.

- Lab orders are tenant-scoped single-test orders with patient and provider linkage, optional `encounter_id`, optional `treatment_item_id`, `lab_provider_key`, requested-test snapshots, workflow timestamps, optional `external_order_id`, and soft-delete retention.
- Lab-order status values are `draft`, `sent`, `specimen_collected`, `specimen_received`, `completed`, and `canceled`.
- Generic `PATCH /lab-orders/{orderId}` is draft-only. Workflow changes happen only through `:send`, `:cancel`, `:mark-collected`, `:mark-received`, and `:mark-complete`.
- `POST /lab-orders/{orderId}:send` requires `labs.manage`, `integrations.manage`, and `Idempotency-Key`, dispatches through a provider gateway selected by `lab_provider_key`, stores `external_order_id`, and transitions the order to `sent`.
- `GET /lab-orders`, `GET /lab-orders/search`, and `GET /lab-orders/export` share the same filter contract: `q`, `status`, `patient_id`, `provider_id`, `encounter_id`, `lab_test_id`, `lab_provider_key`, `ordered_from`, `ordered_to`, `created_from`, `created_to`, and `limit`.
- `POST /lab-orders/bulk` is an all-or-nothing draft-only route. It requires `Idempotency-Key`, accepts `order_ids` plus a shared `changes` object, supports `1..100` distinct ids, and may update only `encounter_id`, `treatment_item_id`, `lab_test_id`, `lab_provider_key`, `ordered_at`, `timezone`, and `notes`.
- Lab tests are tenant-scoped catalog records with `code`, `name`, `specimen_type`, `result_type`, `lab_provider_key`, optional `unit`, optional `reference_range`, optional `description`, optional `external_test_code`, and `is_active`.
- Lab results are read-only order-owned records created through webhook or reconciliation intake. They expose `status = preliminary|final|corrected`, typed value storage, optional `abnormal_flag`, `observed_at`, `received_at`, and provider payload metadata.
- `POST /webhooks/lab/{provider}` is the public inbound route. It requires `Idempotency-Key`, `X-Lab-Signature`, signature verification before state changes, and a payload containing `delivery_id`, `external_order_id`, `status`, `occurred_at`, and optional `results`.
- `POST /webhooks/lab/{provider}:verify` is the authenticated diagnostics helper. It requires tenant scope plus `integrations.manage` and validates a submitted payload and signature without mutating business state.
- `POST /lab-orders:reconcile` requires `labs.manage`, `integrations.manage`, and `Idempotency-Key`. It synchronizes active sent or specimen-in-flight tenant orders through the same provider gateway and result-sync logic used by webhook intake.

- allergy records are patient-owned tenant records with an `allergen_name` snapshot, optional `medication_id`, optional `reaction`, optional `severity`, optional `noted_at`, and optional `notes`
- allergy `severity` values are `mild`, `moderate`, `severe`, and `life_threatening`
- duplicate allergies for the same patient and normalized allergen are rejected
- `GET /patients/{patientId}/medications` projects non-draft prescriptions for the patient and supports optional `status` and `limit` filters
- patient medication views may include an optional medication catalog match by exact `medication_code = medications.code`
- `T047` does not require prescriptions to store `medication_id`; prescription snapshot fields remain authoritative

- invoice status values are `draft`, `issued`, `finalized`, and `void`
- invoice numbering is tenant-scoped monotonic and formatted as `INV-000001`
- create starts in `draft`; generic `PATCH /invoices/{invoiceId}` is draft-only; delete is soft-delete limited to `draft|void`
- explicit lifecycle is `draft -> issued -> finalized`, with `draft|issued|finalized -> void`
- `issue` requires at least one item and a positive total; `finalize` requires `issued`; `void` requires a non-empty reason
- invoice items are draft-only subresources with service snapshots, quantity, unit price, line subtotal, and invoice currency
- omitting invoice-item `unit_price_amount` requires the invoice to reference a price list containing the selected service
- invoice totals equal the sum of item subtotals; taxes, discounts, credits, and payment allocations are deferred beyond `T049`

- Click `Complete` (`action = 1`) with `error = 0` maps local `pending -> captured`
- Click `Complete` (`action = 1`) with `error < 0` maps local `pending -> canceled`
- Click `Prepare` and `Complete` are replay-safe by `click_trans_id` and do not require `Idempotency-Key`
- Uzum webhook transport uses `POST /webhooks/uzum?operation={check|create|confirm|reverse|status}`
- Uzum verification uses the `Authorization` header with configured Basic auth plus payload field `serviceId`
- Uzum request linkage uses `params.payment_id`, with `params.account.value` accepted as a compatibility alias
